# SlimbookFace

Note: **Stable release is for 20.04**, for newer system releases, howdy installation might fail.

Slimbook Face is an application that allows you to graphically manage multiple faces with [boltgolt/howdy](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy) and enable PAM authentication throughout the system, or disable it at login, since login fails in some distributions or desktop environments (like KDE).

To install this application, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and add the Slimbook repo to your system with the following commands:

# Install
```bat
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:slimbook/slimbook
   sudo apt install slimbookface
