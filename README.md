# SlimbookFace

Slimbook Face is an application that allows you to graphically manage multiple faces with [boltgolt/howdy](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy) and enable PAM authentication throughout the system, or disable it at login, since login fails in some distributions or desktop environments (like KDE).

To install this application, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and add the Slimbook repo to your system with the following commands:
